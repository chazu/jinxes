# TARTENGINE

## Syntax

   The TARTENGINE uses json documents to define user interfaces, including widget appearance, layout and data sources.
JSON files can contain one or more widgets, i.e. the document root can be an object describing a single widget, or a list of widgets.

Widgets can be nested within other widgets. Child widgets should be contained within the "children" key of their parent widget.
